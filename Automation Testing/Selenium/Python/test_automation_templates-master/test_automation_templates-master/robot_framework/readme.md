I. Good practice for calling keywords:
1. custom keywords: use underscore in names in python and when calling them
2. user keywords should be declared starting from capitol letter, called with all lower case 
3. external keywords such as selenium's 'Click button' should be called with first capital letter

those rules can help to distinguish if keyword is:
1. from custom library 
2. user's keyword
3. external keyword

II. Comment next to user or custom library keyword 
- put comment in a line with custom keyword or user keyword saying where this keyword is declared
- it will be much easier to find it later
